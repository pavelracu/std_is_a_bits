# std_is_a_bits

This is a game developed during #3 <Academia de Código_> Hackaton by STD Cookers composed by:
 - Helia Marcos
 - David Neves
 - Nuno Pereira
 - Nelson Oliveira
 - Pavel Racu
 - Luis Salvado

After 11 weeks of intensive learning of Java, the beatiful people from <Academia de Código_> gave us a group challenge to 
make a game in 24 hours. And we did it (sort of).

This is a multiplayer game.
