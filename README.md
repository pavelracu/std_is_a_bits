# std_is_a_bits

This is a game developed during #3 <Academia de Código_> Hackaton by STD Cookers composed by:
 - Helia Marcos
 - David Neves
 - Nuno Pereira
 - Nelson Oliveira
 - Pavel Racu
 - Luis Salvado

After 11 weeks of intensive learning of Java, the beautiful people from Academia de Código gave us a group challenge to 
create a game in 24 hours. And we did it (sort of).

This is a multiplayer game. 

 - Game theme - infect the maximum number of cells with your virus.
 - Cells infected will infect other cells.
 - Each player is a virus.
 - Player one moves with arrow keys, player two moves with ASDW keys.

 
 Please enjoy.
